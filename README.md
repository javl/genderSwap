genderSwap
==========
GenderSwap is a browser plugin which replaces all words 
referencing to men with their female equivalent, and
vice versa (him -> her, mother -> father, etc.).

By doing so, many articles you read online which you
would normally

This plugin is a updated version of an old test I wrote. The code 
in this version is based on the Cloud-to-Butt plugin:

Chrome (original version): https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt
Safari: https://github.com/logancollins/cloud-to-butt-safari
(see below for info on the Safari version of genderSwap)
Firefox: https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla
Opera: https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-opera

Safari
==========
It seems Apple tries to make it hard for non OSX devs to build
extentions for Safari, so I didn't bother. Feel free to compile
the code found in the Safari folder of this repository into
a working plugin (please, send me a pull request if you do!).
