# genderSwap ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javl/genderSwap/master/icons/icon_48.png "")

GenderSwap is a browser plugin which replaces words referencing to men with their female equivalent, and vice versa.

Simply substituting one gender for another changes many news posts or articles into oddly distorted texts. For instance, we are not surprised when we read about women being harassed while walking down the street, but swap genders and things start sounding strange and stop 'making sense': "Whenever I bring up the topic of street harassment with women, they tell me they just don’t see it. Literally: When they’re walking down the street with a man, other women don’t make a noise."

genderSwap was made by [Jasper van Loenen](http://jaspervanloenen.com).

The plugin is an updated version of an old test version I wrote a long time ago. The code 
in this new version is based on the Cloud-to-Butt plugin by [Steven Frank](https://github.com/panicsteve), available [here](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

The Safari, Firefox and Opera versions are based on the Cloud-to-Butt ports by [Logan Collins](https://github.com/logancollins) ([Safari version](https://github.com/logancollins/cloud-to-butt-safari)) and [Chris Wright](https://github.com/DaveRandom) ([Firefox version](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla) / [Opera version](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-opera)).

## Note about Safari version
It seems Apple tries to make it hard for non OSX developers to build extentions for Safari, so I didn't bother. Feel free to compile the code found in the Safari folder of this repository into a working plugin (please, send me a pull request if you do!).

##Privacy
The plugin asks permission to access every webpage you visit. This is to replace a set of keywords in the source code; no data whatsoever is recorded or transmitted in any way.
